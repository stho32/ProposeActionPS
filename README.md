# Too much time?

Here is your problem: You actually could do a lot of different things.
Unfurtunately, since corona happened, the world has slowed down.

Now you still have a lot of things that you should do, but there is
a little kick that is missing. Someone or something that can propose
the next best thing to do to you, whenever you loose your motivation.

This powersell script reads the contents of the csv file and 
proposes a random sequence of things to do. 

You add a little time in minutes to each task, so this is the time you
should at minimum use to do that whatever. 
It will show a progress bar. 

And because you do not like simple boring scripts, it will talk to you
and even applaude you for having accomplished each of the random missions.

Of cause, the list of things to do is just an example which can be modified
and extended by you as you see fit.
